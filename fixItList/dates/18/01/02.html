      <ul>
        <li>setup wp site via back pages</li>
        <li>changed its name via back pages [vhosts, hosts, db(phpmyadmin), wp-config] permalinks;</li>
        <li>also added and configured plugins, themes and widgets</li>
        <li><span class="red">note</span> I think the "theme crashing" thing has to do with the themes overriding each other -- and just being careful about how themes are installed. This might be why the testing server is crucial after the localhost so, not to go into this here, but:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>localhost: initial testing</li>
          <li>Testing Server</li>
          <li>Live Server</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Setup Site Two</li>
        <li>Error logging in, something's weird. configs and databases seem on point.</li>
      </ul>
