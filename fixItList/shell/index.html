      <h2>Current CoLang website</h2>

     
    <p>the website currently has two homepages</p>
    <ul>
      <li>there is colang.lin.ufl.edu, which has a home icon linked to it</li>
      <li>colang.lin.ufl.edu/home, that has the word "home" linked to it</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The "true" homepage is colang.lin.ufl.edu/home, as it is the most informative, most up to date, and easiest to navigate of the two.</p>
    <p>In fact, the other homepage (colang.lin.ufl.edu) is quite uninformative and not helpful to us. Many visitors to the website have found it difficult to use that page, and have asked us to let them know when the website is up and running (meaning that that homepage seems under construction to them).</p>

    <ul>
      <li>We would like to implement an automatic redirect from colang.lin.ufl.edu to colang.lin.ufl.edu/home, so that visitors will see the "true" homepage when they visit our website.</li>
      <li>I am not able to access or modify colang.lin.ufl.edu with my current permissions.</li>
    </ul> 


<h3>Response</h3>

  <h4>Priscilla</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>I updated your permissions, so please try the dashboard link again: https://sites.clas.ufl.edu/lin-colang/wp-admin/</li>
  </ul>
     

  <h4>Ken</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>You should be able to set the "Home Page" to the colang.lin.ufl.edu/home page yourself.</li>
    <p>site dashboard >  Settings > Reading | you will get the page that allows you to set this. Set the option "Your homepage displays" to "A static page" then select the "Home" page under the menu selector.</p>
 
    <li>You will also need to set a "Posts" page in much the same way.</li>

  </ul>

<h4>Kate</h4>
  <p>Thank you for help with this and for including the instructions. I was able to change this in settings.</p>
 
<p>so I followed the directions you gave yesterday for the re-direct but now the CoLang course page doesn’t show up when you try to click on that tab…can you help with this?</p>
 
<ul>
  <li>Right now it goes directly to the home page: https://colang.lin.ufl.edu/home/colang-2018-courses/</li>
 </ul>


<h4>Ken</h4>
<p>I just went through all of the links on the menu on the Colang site and they all work except the “Contact Us” link – I am unable to reproduce your problem. What problem are you having exactly?</p>
<p>I’ve verified it works on Safari, Firefox and Chrome browsers.</p>
 
<h4>Kate</h4>
 
<p>My browser didn’t recognize the updates so I cleared that.</p>
 
<ul>
  <li>The main problem is whatever the post page is that is selected, no longer appears as its own page so that when you click on contact us, instead of going to that specific page we have in wordpress it just goes back to the old page.</li>
 </ul>

        <p>End.</p>
