      <h3>Someone Special</h3>
      <p>It’s nice to share the forest with someone. There are things out there that can’t be described by images or words alone. And even to walk hand-in-hand, side-by-side with someone, there are things the other will still never see.</p>

      <h3>Two Friends</h3>
      <p>Away from the cars and keys, just you, you, my camera and me, we walk through the forest trees and tall grass and I search the ground for any sign of someone from before. It’s mostly just balloons out here. They fell from so far away to rest in a place so seldom seen by others.</p>

      <h3>Deep Trees</h3>
      <p>I grabbed this tree or this tree grabbed me. I shot it with my mamiya. And it turned out dark. It was originally dark in reality. And that makes me sad to think about.</p>


      <h3>The End of the Road</h3>
      <p>I grew tired of the endless fight and so I rest my eyes and soul and mind.</p>
