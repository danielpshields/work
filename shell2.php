    [post_content] => University of Florida student Aaron Sandoval, a biology sophomore, has been awarded a Goldwater Scholarship for the 2018-2019 academic year.

Sandoval plans to earn an M.D. and a Ph.D. in Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology before pursuing a research career in regenerative medicine. He is also a UF University Scholar and currently conducts research with Dr. Malcolm Maden, UF biology professor and researcher in the Cancer and Genetics Research Complex.

“I'm proud to have Aaron Sandoval and [honorable mention] Andrew Sack receive recognition from Goldwater for the outstanding records they have compiled at UF,” said Mark Law, director of the UF Honors Program. “They will go on to great things with their research and academic interests.”

The Goldwater Scholarship is the most prestigious undergraduate award in the fields of natural sciences, mathematics and engineering. It is awarded to students who demonstrate outstanding work in these areas and encourages them to continue their career paths.

This year, 1,280 students from 470 institutions were nominated for the scholarship. The Goldwater Foundation awarded 211 nominees with scholarships and named an additional 281 as Honorable Mentions.

Past Goldwater Scholars include other members of the UF Honors Program, Mihael Cudic (2017, electrical engineering), Tiffany Paul (2016, physics), Colin Defant (2015, mathematics) and Lauren McCarthy (2015, chemistry).
