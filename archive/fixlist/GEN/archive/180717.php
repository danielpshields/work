    <h1>Shibbolize Uncovered</h1>

    <ul>

      <li>What do you need shibboleth on it for?</li>

      <li> we wouldn’t really want to add shibboleth since we prefer the more secure sites be on the wordpress server and since it’s currently on the legacy clas site.</li>

      <li>Should you guys be managing that site?  Currently, you still have rights because you still have rights though us but it doesn’t seem to currently be delegated to Advising.</li>

      <li>Best option would probably be to set it up as a separate subsite and shibbolize that either as a new wordpress site on our server or <b>point the url to a server you manage that you can set up shibboleth on</b>.  (We can help if you need it and/or let Allan know we’ve delegated the URL if that’s what’s required.)</li>

      <li>If it really needs to be a legacy site and on the CLAS servers, let me know and we can probably work something out.  It would definitely be switched to a subsite though and regardless I would need the Dean’s Office (Communications) to delegate the site to you guys.</li>

      <li>BTW, the main CLAS site is actually expected to be moved to wordpress soon, if Communications hasn’t spoken to you about it, they’re probably already in the process of copying the site with the current data.</li>

      <li>For general future information, are you managing the server for the advising site?  Is it a hosted site or does Advising run the server?</li>

    </ul>
