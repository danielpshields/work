          <li>the email form is having trouble with redirects. I tested the strlen(); but it turned out to be unrelated. There's some other possibilities like the actual length of the rendered line. But I don't know if it's the actual base email(); or if it's in the housing for the emailWAttachment(); that's been recycled. Math for that:</li>

  <!--

  Redirects:

    3078 (gen formatting) fails
    3073 (gen formatting) passes

    136  (one line / <p> ) == passes
    1088 (one line / <p> ) == passes
    2142 (one line / <p> ) == passes

    4265 (one line / <p> ) == fails
    3078 (one line / <p> ) == fails
    3066 (one line / <p> ) == fails
    2876 (one line / <p> ) == fails
    2771 (one line / <p> ) == fails
    2653 (one line / <p> ) == fails

    2454 (one line / <p> ) == passes
    2500 (one line / <p> ) == passes

    2556 (one line / <p> ) == fails
    2535 (one line / <p> ) == fails
    2516 (one line / <p> ) == fails
    2476 (one line / <p> ) == fails


    at this point:

    There is no correlation between the string length and the redirect's success

    unhappy face :(

          <li>set up a test/shell to see about building a new email function</li>
        </ul>
        <li>started writing own email(); it's going well. there's something about passing in a variable -- i think into an html format -- it's weird -- only because it did actually submit a version using a variable defined on the same page. neat stuff :)</li>
