      <h1>190228_thursday</h1>

      <ul>
        <li>7:52 a.m.</li>
        <li>dropped off socks with Kelly for the donation thing</li>
        <li>[PaCE]</li>
        <li>[meeting, UFO] combed through AAC UFO Site, noted changes</li>
        <li>[meetin, Nicole] combed PaCE contract, added functionality to Site</li>
        <li>[UFO, PaCE]</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Thought for a while about how to build out the changes -- it's weird trying to format all of the things and keep the page clean -- I'm sure it'll be one of those things looking back shows how over thunk it was</li>
          <li>started making progress when:</li>
        </ul>
        <li>[Advising] lynn canceled the advising meeting</li>
        <li>[GEN, brittany grubbs, beyond 120]</li>
        <ul>
          <li>hacked the beyond120 site -- ...aac/../beyond120/internships -- this was a goose chase</li>
          <li>eventually just created a folder of the same name and pasted in the source code, making the requested changes</li>
          <li>the links the checked out so emailed as finished</li>
        </ul>
        <li>[GEN, Headcount] the headcount page is down: tim emailed me</li>
        <ul>
          <li>checked phpmyadmin for conflicts</li>
          <li>checked cgi file (why is it cgi?)</li>
          <li>checked the source code</li>
          <li>checked the tables mentioned in the source code</li>
          <li>this was mostly a skim to make sure nothing was really weird, but i'd have to test the thing to figure it out -- and I just don't have time</li>
        </ul>
        <li>[ln] close Thursday (190228, 5:15 p.m.)</li>
      </ul>
