      <h3>morning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>[groceries]</li>
        <li>finished the image($index);</li>
        <li>struggled to get the CS6 suite onto the iMac</li>

      <h3>afternoon</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>CS6 upload ();</li>
        <ul>
          <li>had to hop between putting the programs on an external drive, to learning Adobe says you're pirating software if you try to install it on more than two locations</li>
          <li>the legacy iMac held up and allowed all of the information to be unistalled, freeing up the install</li>
          <li>the new iMac is without a CD drive, so drove to Jim's to borrow his. It worked! But the pirating thing. So, uninstall from iMac, uninstall from the [lonesome:] </li>
          <li>CS6 ()</li>
        </ul>
        <li>scanned in the Holga images</li>
        <li>phone()</li>
        <ul>
          <li>pulling an image from Photos is a nightmare, used Terminal to mv * ~/</li>
          <li>sorting 2,600 took hours. tedious. stopping gathering until I'm caught up. Especially with Grabs(shell hammer); looming</li>
        </ul>
        <li>servers</li>
        <ul>
          <li>i'm a little lost as to what the best thing to do</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>

      <h3>after</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>sort photos / push to server (10:40 p.m.)</li>
        <li>...following up on yesterday's rant, organization is coming in parts from different sections. It's all confusing. But it's just a matter of doing the next right thing. So the server has a semi-correct order for handling files. There's a split between [grabs(shellhammer)] and [image/images/($image); But I believe it's sorting itself. There are three areas to mind:</li>
        <ol>
          <li>Git: </li>
          <li>Drives: </li>
          <li>Server: </li>
        </ol>
        <li>Each of those has a different purpose. Git needs to be, and is relatively, light. It's a function box to call the heavier stuff. So either process the media down to a reasonable size, or call ghosts? idk.</li>
        <li>but the sorting seems to be taking care of itself</li>
        <li>also, there's a deep need to protect the shellhammer drives</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>late</h3>

        <li>[budget(ish)]</li>
