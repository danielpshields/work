        <ul>
          <li>work scheduled for fixlist on cal/deptRoot and I'm preoccupied with the computer shipping, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvMS_ykiLiQ" target="_blank">leelah</a>, the file/folder structure thing and all of my media just venerably sitting in the apartment, the sink dripping, needing to take my car in. It's not that much -- and everything's fine, but the "this is life, this is normal" thing almost makes it worse, because there's always going to be stuff like this, life is always going to be mildly uncomfortable. Welcome to post 30, I guess. I like that the Spanish word for worry is preocupado</li>
          <li>The file/folder sort halted things. I was about to get to [blog] posts -- I was [print]ing out a handle for the camera before that -- the screen went blank, and I ordered a new computer -- and I think that scared me into needing to get the media structure in order. I lost the amsterdam photos. And I'm afraid to lose more stuff, but it's more that I want to be able to reference and find -- to call -- to use -- I want the perfect system so I can move forward with development. And it feels late to be doing this at 30. But it's just the one life. When else would I start?</li>
