          <li>[ticket] 10963558 - Psych, there's something strange happening here. I was unable to find the page needing the edits. And I'm unsure if I'm even supposed to make the edits. But the file/page structure is strange within the Psych layout. I responded that I was unable to find where the content was being drawn from to supply that directory > graduate-students page.</li>
          <p><i>It was linked as a post page. Looking more into this.</i></p>
          <p><i>There's code that displays the children</i></p>
          <p><i>Turned out to be a page that was unsearchable by certain terms</i></p>
