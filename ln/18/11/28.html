          <li>that was fun</li>
          <li>Its only real downfalls are “too much navigation” and general redundancy. The “too much navigation” thing isn’t that big of a deal. It actually helps the sidebar navigation menu stand out a bit more. But the mobile navigation is probably where there’s the biggest cost by adding another Page.
            The general redundancy thing just means that the information could be placed somewhere in the already-existing Site structure.
            I think the information, as it is now, is two straightforward bios. And that limits them to being placed on their own Page under Bios – which is “Faculty” So, I think a stand-alone faculty Page is the right call right now.
            If the information was more like a letter or something reaching out to students / the public, then Dr. Harfe’s information would fit wonderfully on the Home / Index Page. And I believe yours would fit nicely on the Program Features Page. But as long as they’re in biography form, I think their own Page is a sensible option.
