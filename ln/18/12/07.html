        <li>[Study] php includes</li>
        <ul>
          <li>it's based on the document that's called</li>
          <li>I had some weird stuff happen with the relativity of the includes in the email program where it was calling includes from within the includes folder instead of being relative to where the root document. I tried to replicate this in a shell / clean code and found that the normal relativity, where everything is based on its placement to the root document, was not only the correct way, but the incorrect, broken, path broke the Page.</li>

          <li>started writing out the SQL / PHP to pull the information down from localhost -- i don't think the database will transfer from the localhost -- and I'm a little surprised I have to wonder if that would happen. It's stored within /etc/ or one of those.</li>
