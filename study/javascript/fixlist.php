  <h2>Variables</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>`const` is a signal that the identifier won’t be reassigned.</li>
    <li>`let`, is a signal that the variable may be reassigned, such as a counter in a loop, or a value swap in an algorithm. It also signals that the variable will be used only in the block it’s defined in, which is not always the entire containing function.</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>Datatypes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>"typeof" -- gets the data type</li>
  </ul>
