        <h2>Course Information</h2>
        <p>PHPB is a structured two-year program. Most courses are taken in sections just for students in the PHPB cohort.  Courses are offered once per year.</p>
        <p>Students in PHPB are expected to take rigorous courses loads of 15 credits per semester to demonstrate the ability to do the course loads required in healthcare professional schools.</p>
        <p>There are additional required courses unique to PHPB to assist with gaining knowledge and skills required for professional preparation. All students in PHPB are required to take these courses.</p>
        <p>Once admitted, an individualized academic plan will be completed for each student taking into account previously completed courses.</p>
        <p>All courses five or more years old or with less than a B earned must be retaken.</p>
        <p>If there are other courses required for a professional school that are not part of the PHPB curriculum, these may be taken following completion of PHPB.  There is no guarantee of taking these courses at UF.</p>

      <h3>Pre-Matriculation</h3>
      <p>All students admitted to PHPB must complete:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>MAC1147 Pre-Calculus and CHM1025 Intro to Chemistry or approved equivalents with grades of Bs or above.</li>
        <li>If admitted to the ReStart track these courses must be taken at UF.</li>
        <li>Online or in-residence enrollment at UF is possible. Taking these at UF will provide the best preparation for taking PHPB chemistry and math courses.</li>
        <li>Please contact us for more information.</li>
