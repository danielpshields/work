  <p class="quoteSlug">As a Career Changer, the PHPB Program saved me precious time and resources. Instead of pursuing a second four-year Bachelors degree, the PHPB Program's curriculum allowed me to complete the necessary pre-requisites in two years. I can confidently say the program's rigor prepared me for the academic challenges of dental school. More importantly, the individual advising and mentorship I received helped me become a more desirable, well-rounded, and competitive applicant. Thank you PHPB for playing an instrumental role in helping me achieve my goal of attending the University of Florida College of Dentistry!</p>
