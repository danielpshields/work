PHPB is a rigorous, two year structured program.</p><p>Courses are offered once per year.  Students in PHPB complete the majority of courses in classes created just for PHPB students, experiencing the outstanding teaching faculty at the University of Florida. This is a comprehensive program offering non-science courses that assist you in developing academic skills, application skills, and professional competencies necessary for application to medical, dental, PA, or veterinary school.</p><p>Other health professions are considered. However, for professions other than medicine, pre-requisite courses not included in our standard curriculum are not offered.</p><strong><p><span id="applicationSlug">2019 Fall Application Cycle via <a href="https://postbaccas.liaisoncas.com/">PostBacCAS</a> opens August 15, 2018</span></p></strong><h3>Tracks</h3><p>The UF PHPB program offers two tracks to help you complete pre-requisite coursework.
