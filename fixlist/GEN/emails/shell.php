<p>The College of Liberal Arts & Sciences (CLAS) academic advisors conduct almost 30,000 in-person <a href="https://www.advising.ufl.edu/advising/advisingservices/">student advising sessions</a> each year while maintaining an average student-submitted rating of 4.7 out of 5. Along with office walk-ins, our advisors also attend to <a href="https://www.advising.ufl.edu/about/advisingservices/#email">email advising</a>, <a href="https://www.advising.ufl.edu/about/advisingservices/#phone">phone advising</a>, group advising, and represent CLAS at various campus functions and national advising organizations. Among us, we have numerous university- and nationally-recognized <a href="https://www.advising.ufl.edu/advising/leadership/">leaders and awardees</a>.</p>

Spillane<br />Director, Academic Advising Center<br />Associate Dean for Student Affairs<br />Email: spillane@ufl.edu</h3>
<p>In addition to overseeing the operations of the Academic Advising Center as the Director, I also serve as the CLAS Associate Dean for Student Affairs.  In that capacity, I work with the Dean’s Office and the departmental undergraduate coordinators to ensure that all CLAS students have access to appropriate courses and advising.  I also serve as the college’s liaison to various university-level committees, such as the curriculum committee, the commencement committee, and more. I am a historian by training, and have been a member of the History faculty at UF since 1995, researching and teaching modern American history, especially the history of drugs, crime, and the criminal justice system.  My goal as Director and Associate Dean is really the same as in the classroom&mdash;to ensure that all students are getting the best possible undergraduate experience.  Our undergrads are the university’s greatest asset.  Each student deserves the chance to make the most of their time in CLAS!

<h3>Lynn B. O'Sickey<br />
Associate Director<br />
AAC Advising<br />Email: losickey@advising.ufl.edu</h3>
<p>I help to manage the operations of the CLAS Academic Advising Center.  In that capacity, I troubleshoot issues for students, faculty and parents.  Frequently, I work to get policies and procedures clarified or simplified to ease the administrative life of undergraduate students. I help the AAC and the College to collect and use data to make decisions that are designed to enhance the undergraduate student experience and student success.  I serve on numerous committees and often share the front-line perspectives of undergraduates and academic advisors.  </p>

<p>As someone who struggled academically as an undergrad, I get great satisfaction helping students avoid or successfully navigate potential struggles.  I also love helping students open their minds to the breadth of opportunities available to them and the range of possibilities their futures can hold.   In many cases, students are unaware of the many, many paths they can take to achieve their goals.  Helping students clarify those goals and then find the right path for them is immensely gratifying.</p>

Associate Director<br />CLAS UFOnline Advising<br />
Email: gkepic@advising.ufl.edu</h3>
<p>I share my time between the AAC and the UF Online Office, where I advise Criminology students who were admitted prior to Summer 2015. I oversee the advising and programming for all CLAS UF Online students. I also assist the UF Online program in managing curriculum issues and policies related on-line programs.</p.
<p>I have been in the AAC since 1995 and began working with the UF Online Office in Spring of 2015. My contributions include chairing the college Petitions Committee, creating and chairing the college Appeals Committee, coordinated the efforts of the Retention Team, and I created and coordinate the European Studies portion of the UF in Salzburg Overseas Study program (2004 – present). My passion is working with students individually and in groups. I served as faculty advisor for the CLAS Student council for several years and started the UF chapter of a national honor society (Tau Sigma) for UF transfer students. I have also enjoyed teaching the Flexible Learning section of SLS 1501 (College Success) since 2004. I have presented at over 20 national and regional conferences on various topics related to academic advising, delivered a few Keynote addresses at advising events, and served numerous leadership roles in the National Academic Advising Association, including member of the Board of Directors and Vice President.</p>
<p>I was born in Queens, NY, grew up in Allentown, PA, and lived in 6 different states before settling in Florida. I earned a Bachelor's and Master's degree from George Mason University in Fairfax Virginia, where I attended on a wrestling scholarship. One of the best "teachers" I ever had was my college wrestling coach who helped me realize that my sport provided the opportunity to make it to college, but it was my education that would give me the opportunity to make it in life.</p>

<p>I advise CLAS majors, exploratory students, pre-law students, and students in the AIM Program. I assist with the advising-related initiatives for new students, including annual Preview orientation for UF’s 6,600+ first-year students. I have served on multiple campus committees, including the Machen Florida Opportunity Scholars (MFOS) Steering Committee, Academic Integrity Task Force, and Student Conduct Committee, and have served as a mentor in the Reitz Scholars Program and the University Minority Mentorship Program. I have been active in NACADA (National Academic Advising Association) and am on the Board for SAPLA (Southern Association of Pre-law Advisors). I love helping students to have a successful transition to the University. I realize UF can seem large and daunting, and I enjoy helping students to feel at ease by showing them there are friendly people here to help. I encourage all students to find an advisor with whom they connect, meet with that advisor regularly, and ask lots of questions. There are many fabulous academic opportunities at UF, and we love to help you find a path that’s a great fit for you! </p>

Email: kathyrex@advising.ufl.edu</h3>
<p>The special populations the college serves include pre-professional students (pre-health and pre-law), as well as students coded “exploratory” and AIM. In addition to advising general CLAS students, I work specifically with students admitted through the AIM Program. I also contribute to the services the college extends to exploratory students and serve on the steering committee for the Machen Florida Opportunity Scholars program. I graduated with my Bachelor’s degree from American University in communications and foreign language media. After working for about six years in the non-profit field, I returned to school to get my Master’s degree from the University of Florida in student personnel and higher education administration. My journey into academic advising was a slightly unorthodox one, full of unexpected surprises. I try to use the experience to help guide students through what can be the intimidating process of finding a major and also to help them try to make the most of their undergraduate years. </p>

<p>I provide advising for all students in CLAS as well as students from all colleges who need pre-health advising. I love helping our future doctors, dentists, and veterinarians prepare for such demanding careers and seeing them achieve their goal of entering professional school. I also sit on the Student Conduct Committee and the Undergraduate Advising Council for the university. I’m happy to say I’ve always been a Gator and earned both of my degrees here. I went through most of my time as an undergraduate student completely undecided about my career path, so I can also relate to students who have not yet discovered what they want to do in life. Through experiences like travelling, teaching, and taking on a variety of jobs I finally discovered that I love working with college students. I hope I can help you find your path and reach your goals during your time at UF! </p>

<p>I am the pre-health advisor for UF First Year/Freshmen students in CLAS and all other colleges at UF.  I also advise First Year/Freshmen students who are Biology majors in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (CLAS).   I retired from UF in 2014 as the Coordinator of the Microbiology and Cell Science (MCS) undergraduate major and program.  The MCS major is offered in two colleges at UF so I was the primary advisor for students in this major in CLAS and also in the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences (CALS).  During those fifteen years I worked very closely with the former and current pre-health advisors since many of my majors were also pre-health students.  Prior to that position, I worked as a general advisor for the First & Second year students in the College of Health and Human Performance.  For 20 years prior to my advising positions, I was an Elementary and Middle School teacher/coach for the Marion County and Alachua County School Boards with a background in Fitness, Health & Wellness.  I am a true orange and blue gator who received my B.S. and M.Ed. from UF.  I am delighted to be back to work in the AAC working with so many talented and ambitious students so please come see me when you get settled in at UF as a Freshmen so I can assist you with your pre-health and other academic needs.</p>

<p>My role in the AAC is to provide academic advising to all CLAS majors, as well as students who are interested in pre-health professions from all majors at UF.  I have worked at UF professionally for over five years, and my first role at UF was in the Office of Admissions working with readmissions and transfer students, freshman students and transfer evaluations. For the past four years I was the Academic Advisor for the Innovation Academy program here at UF, which allowed me to be cross trained across many majors and colleges as well as the specialist in the Innovation minor and program.  My Bachelor’s degree was awarded from the UF College of Liberal Arts and Sciences with a major in Anthropology, and it has served me well when working with diverse student populations at UF. I finished my Masters of Education degree in Spring 2017 and began my journey in LS in July 2017. In my free time I love to be with my family, husband, two children and our pups. I am also a huge advocate of nature and I am an Advanced Scuba Diver through UF, where I have dove to depths of over 110 feet at the U.S.S. Spiegel Grove!

More recently, I have worked as an academic advisor for international students at Santa Fe College, and I am currently a graduate student in UF’s College of Education. My own experiences and participating in my students’ experiences have taught me that each path is (and should be) unique. Any student can customize their college experience to maximize his or her life during and after that time, and I greatly appreciate the opportunity to help in that process through my advising. </p>

<p>I primarily advise Biology, Geology, and Geography majors in our UF Online program. I received my Bachelor of Music from Stetson University and my Master of Music from right here at the University of Florida, both in flute performance. So how did I become a CLAS advisor? As an undergrad, I held work-study positions in University Operations and Admissions which lead me to my graduate assistantship in Admissions and Undergraduate Students Services. Through these experiences, I discovered and developed my passion for advising and student success! One of the best parts of my job is getting to know and work with students pursuing a degree from UF from all walks of life, all over the world! When I’m not advising, I stay active in the community performing in local orchestras, directing the Gainesville Flute Ensemble, and teaching flute lessons. Go Gators!</p>

<h3>Andie Cochran<br />
Associate Director for the Career and Industry Engagement<br />Email: andreamcochran@ufl.edu</h3>

<p>I am an extension of the Career Connection Center that works with students, faculty and staff from the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, as well as connects employers to CLAS. I meet with students one on one, facilitate workshops, work with faculty and staff to bring CRC services to students and work with employers that are eager to recruit Liberal Arts and Sciences students. As a former Liberal Arts and Sciences undergrad, I was able to translate my Psychology degree into a career in the hospitality industry that allowed me to use a variety of transferrable skills. I am able to bring this knowledge to my role at the UF Career Connection Center with the hope to share it with students in order to guide and motivate their career exploration.</p>

<p>I manage the AAC website, Preview Prep, a few other UF sites and tools. In this role, I have the great fortune to work with all the teams of the AAC to assist incoming students, different student populations, and communicate helpful information. My path from college started in online journalism, writing articles about federal tax news legislation and becoming the office computer guy. From there, I moved more into tech, working at Cisco Systems in Silicon Valley and Microsoft in Washington. We moved to Florida--where my wife grew up--and now I help advisors help thousands of students every year.</p>
