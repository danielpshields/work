Standards
I built a dynamic Website for the Pre-health Post-Baccalaureate Program (PHPB).  I built online forms and a restructured Dashboard Site for the UF Online program. And I’ve created a folder as a repository for general functions.


Guidelines

A legacy Site, or legacy program, is an ain’t-broke-don’t-fix-it situation. And my first six months were spent respecting the notion that working within a legacy environment required an understanding of both technical scaffolding and the content itself. Maintaining the process needed to make code dynamic and media up to modern standards was a result of communicating with my peers, directors and the outside tech community. That practice made work that was ultimately peer tested to have functional, navigable and intuitive interfaces.


Principles

The folder mentioned above that holds general functions is important because it’s a departmental resource created from discussions with others within the department. Dan sent me chunks of code, others described wouldn’t-it-be-nice scenarios, and my coding assembled them into clean, callable functions and features.

I believe piecing those things together to share with others, the same as their bones and concepts were shared with me, has been the core of what I’ve been able to do in six months.

Information has been freely given to me since the start of my time with the AAC. I’ve been encouraged to speak and freely express myself.  And in the next period I’d like to continue those discussions. I believe they’ll help in increasing accessibility across platforms. The code I’ve written was designed to be a base structure to sync with more advanced features and deeper and more creative ideas. I’d like to use the next six months to plug those in.

I’d like to further practice using tutorial from resources like Lynda.com and local meetups to further practice with programs like Illustrator and languages like MySQL (and PHP). MySQL and Illustrator represent this position’s respective front- and back-end relevancies. I’ve often found these are areas which proficiency would make me a more valuable employee specifically to the AAC. JavaScript I would also like to study Unix / Bash scripting and SEO.  I believe a more thorough understanding of Unix would help with understanding the capabilities of expanding Git beyond my own use as a version control system acting as a file manager. It would give me the vocabulary that I believe is needed to speak on a level high enough to encourage collaboration so the functions folder is more capable of accepting outside contributions. Though, the folder is currently synced as a GitHub repository, I seek the deeper knowledge required to explain its complexities in a simple way. And finally my interest in SEO is coupled with a desire to improve at working with filter-based analytics. My initial six months were spent building a foundation for content to be dynamic. I believe the biggest benefit of that flexibility is the ability to adjust to change. I believe analytics are the best and most object to understand what needs to move, to change -- how to adapt.

Thank you for everything,

Alex Catalano
