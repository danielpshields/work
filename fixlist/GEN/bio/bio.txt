<!-- I'm a Web Developer for the AAC. I work for the Pre-Health Post-Bacc and CLAS UF Online programs, and help out in other areas. I was a journalism major at UF. And I've continued working with Web Development and multimedia in various roles since graduating. My favorite color is blue. I like playing with techy things like 3D printing. And I like to camp as much as possible. -->
