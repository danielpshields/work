      <h1>Content Management Systems (CMS) vs. Traditional Code</h1>
    </header>

    <p class="slug"><i>The better option is determined by the level of control the owner needs over the Site once it's completed. Either option will require some work:</i></p>

    <h2>CLAS WordPress Site</h2>

    <p>The CLAS WordPress theme will need to have code written to format the Site to support its original contents. It needs a repopulating of appropriately formatted media. It will also require restoring custom features like the secondary navigation display, drop down behaviors and interactive graphics.</p>

    <h3>Pros</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Features / Plugins</b>: simple access to advanced features like forms</li>
      <li><b>Web Accessibility Standards</b>: immediate / instant</li>
      <li><b>Users</b>: anyone can add, delete and edit pages</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cons</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>simple tasks are more complex | i.e. WYSIWYG -- Text editing is relatively simple, but formatting efficacy, like found in a word processor, can be difficult to obtain/implement</li>
      <li>complex / custom tasks are more complex | i.e. SVGs -- Advanced features can require more work due to having to work within a CMS environment</li>
      <li>CMS problems become PHPB Site problems</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>AAC Traditional Code Site</h2>

    <p>The AAC traditional code version will need to score higher on Web accessibility standards. And it will potentially need be restyled to mimic the current CLAS theme's settings.</p>

    <h3>Pros</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>structure</b>: established, malleable / dynamic Site structure</li>
      <li><b>custom anything</b>: Custom features are easier to build and implement</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Cons</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Theme</b>: the color scheme differs from the CLAS WordPress theme and uniformity is a strength in a departmental Website</li>
      <li><b>Accessibility</b>: the web accessibility need to be updated to score higher on standards</li>
    </ul>
