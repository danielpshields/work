The UF Speech and Debate Team has a long and rich history. This section of our website is designed to help us share that history. In the tabs on the left you will find Awards given out by the team, Spotlights on Alumni, and even old photographs of the team.

Attention Alumni! We are currently gathering old photos of the team to build this history section. If you have photos to share, please send them to ufspeechanddebate@gmail.com along with any information about the photos (i.e. names, year, location, or whatever else you remember and want to share)
