            <h3>Pre-Health Post-Baccalaureate Program (PHPB)</h3>
            <p>The University of Florida's Pre-health Post-Baccalaureate Program (PHPB) offers dedicated and motivated students an opportunity to complete comprehensive academic and professional preparation for admission to healthcare professional schools. PHPB is a rigorous, two year structured program. Fall admission only.</p>

            <p>Students in PHPB complete courses in classes created just for PHPB students. This is a comprehensive program offering step by step advising, professional development and non-science courses to assist you in developing skills and competencies necessary for application to a healthcare professional graduate school such as medical, dental and veterinary medical schools.</p>

            <p>Other health professions are considered. However, for professions other than medicine, pre-requisite courses not included in our standard curriculum will be taken after completion of the PHPB program.</p>

            <h3>Tracks</h3>
            <p>The UF PHPB program offers two tracks to help you complete pre-requisite coursework. Each track requires full-time enrollment. The track you choose depends on your academic background. All tracks require a bachelor's degree for admission. For more information on each track, see the Admission and Course information.</p>
