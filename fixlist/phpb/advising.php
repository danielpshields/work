  <h1>Advising</h1>
  <p>Students will work closely with a pre-health advisor throughout the program. You will be required to meet with your advisor at least once per semester to discuss your current courses and plan for the next semester. Advisors are also available Monday-Friday if you ever have questions that need to be answered. During your first semester you will take a pre-health seminar course to gain more in-depth knowledge about the profession. In the last year there will be workshops to assist with the application process.</p>

    <p><strong>Phone Advising (non-peak times only)</strong><br />We are not currently offering phone advising. If you are a current UF student not in Gainesville and need to speak with a Pre-Health advisor you can call 352-273-4083 to schedule a phone appointment. Incoming and non-UF students may <a href="mailto:prehealth@advising.ufl.edu">email a Pre-Health advisor</a>.</p>
<p>*Walk-in and phone advising are generally for advising questions of 15 minutes or less. If you have numerous or lengthy questions please schedule an appointment. Advisors will make every effort to see all students who sign in. However, we reserve the right to stop accepting walk-in students depending on the number of students already waiting and the amount of time left in the walk-in shift. If you arrive later in the shift you may be instructed to return on a different day.</p>
