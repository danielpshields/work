    <h3>Advising</h3>
    <p>Students will work closely with the program director to establish a professional development plan for building a competitive application. You will meet with the director at least once per semester to discuss and assess your plan and progress in PHPB.</p>
    <p>The director is also available Monday through Friday if you ever have questions that need to be answered. During your first semester you will take a pre-health seminar course to gain more in-depth knowledge about the profession. Professional development groups will encourage the knowledge and skills needed for application and interviews. The director will assist you step by step with what is needed for a competitive application.</p>
