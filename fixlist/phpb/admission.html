Most admitted applicants have minimum cumulative and upper-division GPAs of 3.0. Most students who are successful in gaining admission to medical, dental, and veterinary medicine schools have GPAs of 3.5 and higher.</li>	<li>Have completed MAC1147 and CHM1025 or their equivalents with a minimum grade of B or above prior to admission. Non-UF students may be able to take these courses online through UF prior to beginning the program. Please contact us for more information.</li>	<li>Have worked or volunteered in a clinical setting or in another service related capacity prior to application.</li>	<li>Show evidence of academic abilities necessary to complete the demands of the pre-health program.</li>	<li>Students are NOT eligible for admission if they completed three or more of the required science pre-requisite courses in the past five years. </li>	<li>Have a minimum of 3.0 in any pre-professional science courses already completed.</li></ul><p>The Admissions Committee reviews each applicant carefully taking into consideration the academic background, previous institutions, courses completed, GPAs earned, evaluations, and essays. The rigor and quality of the applicantï¿½s undergraduate curriculum is strongly considered as evidence of having achieved the academic skills necessary for successful completion of this program.  Most applicants will have completed work or volunteer hours in a clinical setting and demonstrated knowledge of the profession they are pursuing.</p><p>Applicants will be admitted to the fall semester on a rolling basis. A supplemental program application is required for consideration for admission.  All applications will be reviewed after the submission deadline.  The most competitive applicants will be admitted on a space available basis.   </p><p>Once admitted, students must maintain a 3.0 GPA with a B or above in all courses to remain in the program. Tuition for the program is $525 per credit hour plus additional fees. Pursuing academic requirements alone is inadequate for application to healthcare professional graduate programs.  This program requires students to participate in medically related service and research experiences. These positions are secured by the student. This program has no linkages with professional schools/programs and in no way guarantees admission.</p><h3 id="application">Application</h3><p>Follow the steps below to be sure your application is considered complete:</p><ol>	<li><strong><a href="docs/PreHealthPostBacApplication.pdf">Download and complete the University of Florida Pre-Health Post-Baccalaureate Supplemental Application.</a></strong> Send to:<br />	<table class="table">	<tr>		<td>Email:</td><td><a href="mailto:phpostbac@clas.ufl.edu">PHPostbac@clas.ufl.edu</a></td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td>Fax:</td><td>(352) 392-2905</td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td>Mail:</td><td>Pre-Health Post-Bac Program<br />Academic Advising Center<br />Farrior Hall<br />100 Fletcher Drive<br />PO Box 112015<br />Gainesville, FL 32611-2015</td>	</tr>			</table>					</li>		<li>Complete the <strong><a href="http://www.admissions.ufl.edu/pdf/postbacapp.pdf">University of Florida Post-Baccalaureate Application</a></strong>.
