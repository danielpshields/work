Can I apply to the program?</strong><br />No. Our program is intended for students who have not yet completed the pre-requisite courses.</p><p><strong>Can I apply if I am an out of state resident?</strong><br />Yes, you may apply if you are not a Florida resident. No preference is given to Florida residents in the admission process.</p><p><strong>Can I take other UF courses while in the program?</strong><br />Students in the Pre-Health Post-Bac program may be allowed to take additional elective courses. You will need to discuss your proposed schedule with an advisor prior to registering.</p><p><strong>Can I apply to professional school right after finishing the program?</strong><br />Yes. At the end of the program you will be ready to take the MCAT (or DAT) exam and apply to professional school.</p><p><strong>Can I apply for admission if I am currently finishing my Bachelor's degree?</strong><br />Yes. As long as your bachelor's degree is awarded prior to your first semester in the program, you are welcome to apply.</p><p><strong>If I completed most of the pre-requisite courses already, but did not do well in them, am I eligible to apply?</strong><br />Yes. If you have been out of school for at least two years, you can apply to our ReStart track. This track allows you to retake your science courses and complete those you've never taken.</p><p><strong>I don't have a 3.0 undergraduate GPA, can I apply anyway?</strong><br />In rare circumstances we may consider applicants who have below a 3.0 GPA. If you feel as though you warrant an exception you may submit an additional appeal.</p><p><strong>How long will it take me to complete the program?</strong><br />Most students in the Career Changer and ReStart tracks should be able to complete the program in 5 semesters including summer. We recommend enrolling in a second summer in order to take additional higher level science courses.</p><p><strong>Upon completion of the program, am I guaranteed admission to UF's College of Medicine?</strong><br />No. There is no formal linkage program between the UF Pre-Health Post-Bac program and any UF professional program.</p></div> <!--#include virtual="includes/sidebar.php"--><!--#include virtual="includes/footer.php"-->	</body></html>
