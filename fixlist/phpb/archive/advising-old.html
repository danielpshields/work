You will be required to meet with your advisor at least once per semester to discuss your current courses and plan for the next semester. Advisors are also available Monday-Friday if you ever have questions that need to be answered. During your first and last semesters you will take a pre-health seminar course with the pre-health advisors to gain more in-depth knowledge about preparing for the profession and the application process. </p>		<p>Walk-in advising is available in Farrior Hall.
