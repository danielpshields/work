Students who have a few courses completed may apply, however, students who have already completed a significant portion of the pre-requisite coursework are not eligible.</p><p><strong>Can I apply if I am an out of state resident?</strong><br />Yes, you may apply if you are not a Florida resident. No preference is given to Florida residents in the admission process. </p><!--<p><strong>Can I apply if I am an international student?</strong><br />Yes, you may apply if you are an international student, however, be aware that many U.S. medical schools give preference to U.S. citizens and permanent residents. Be sure to discuss your situation with a pre-health advisor.</p>--><p><strong>Can I take other UF courses while in the program?</strong><br />Students in the Pre-Health Post-Bac program may be allowed to take additional elective courses. You will need to discuss your proposed schedule with an advisor prior to registering.</p><p><strong>Can I apply to professional school right after finishing the program?</strong><br />Yes. At the end of the program you will be ready to take the MCAT (or DAT) exam and apply to professional school.</p><p><strong>Can I apply for admission if I am currently finishing my Bachelor's degree?</strong><br />Yes. As long as your bachelor's degree is awarded prior to your first semester in the program, you are welcome to apply.</p><p><strong>If I completed most of the pre-requisite courses already, but did not do well in them, am I eligible to apply?</strong><br />No. This program is not intended to be a record-enhancer. </p><p><strong>I don't have a 3.0 undergraduate GPA, can I apply anyway?</strong><br />In rare circumstances we may consider applicants who have below a 3.0 GPA. If you feel as though you warrant an exception you may submit an additional appeal.</p><p><strong>How long will it take me to complete the program?</strong><br />Most students should be able to complete the program in 5 semesters including summer. We recommend enrolling in a second summer in order to take additional higher level science courses.</p><p><strong>Upon completion of the program, am I guaranteed admission to UF's College of Medicine?</strong><br />No. There is no formal linkage program between the UF Pre-Health Post-Bac program and any UF professional program.</p></div> <!--#include virtual="includes/nav.html"--><!--#include virtual="includes/footer.php"-->	</body></html>
