  <h1>Financial Information</h1>
  <p>This step in your medical education represents an important and significant investment. Tuition for the program is $400 per credit hour plus additional fees (approximately $60 per credit hour) for Florida residents and $525 per credit hour plus fees for non-Florida residents. Students will have access to the same services and resources that are available to residential students who pay local fees, such as access to the recreational centers, Student Health Care Center, Counseling and Wellness Center, and athletic events . There is no difference in the tuition rate based on residency status. While financial aid is limited, you may be eligible for (12 months) of Federal Financial Aid. Students applying for aid must complete a <a href="https://fafsa.ed.gov/" target="_blank">FAFSA application</a> as soon as possible. Private funding may also be available. Students should contact the <a href="http://www.sfa.ufl.edu/" target="_blank">Office for Student Financial Affairs</a> to explore their funding options.</p>
