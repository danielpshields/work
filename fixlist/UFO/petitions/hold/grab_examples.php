  Appointment Notes:
  Name:  Amanda Miller
  Major:  AOM
  Phone:  239-250-2858
  Status:  Inactive; Last attended in 2007
  Reason for Appt: Interested in UFO CJ. Had several semesters of really rough grades. Lots of Es on transcript. After leaving UF, she got an AA in paralegal studies. Wasnâ€™t sure if that would impact her being able to return or not. I recommended she speak to you about it because I honestly was not sure either. She mentioned mental health issues while she was last attending, so not sure if she could do a retro?
