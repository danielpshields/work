<p>I have attached the College Petition form to this email. You will need to complete Boxes C, E, and F. In Box C you are requesting that you stay in the Criminology major despite the 2 prior attempts of a major course, STA2023. In Box E, you can put 3 hours, and I will complete Box F once you send these materials back to me. We will also need a one paged, typed personal statement detailing the need to take STA2023 at another institution. Once I get these and fill out my part, I will forward it to the petitions committee from there. </p>
