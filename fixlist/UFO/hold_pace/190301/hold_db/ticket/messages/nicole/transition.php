Hi Jared,

Congratulations! It looks like you should be able to transition to campus this Spring assuming that you:

1.	Successfully complete your current courses with Cs or better
2.	Maintain a 2.0 UF GPA
3.	Earn a B- or better in AMH 2010 to establish a 2.5 major GPA for History

Attached you will find a copy of the contract that you will need to complete and return to this email address (you may sign this form digitally). This contract will allow you the opportunity to let us know how you would like to move forward and give us the permission to process your transition accordingly.

If you return the signed contract prior to your scheduled registration date, you will be able to advance registration for your Spring residential courses on that date, assuming you have cleared your other holds. Please be diligent about checking your holds prior to Spring advance registration. They have not yet released the Spring registration start times, but the Spring 2019 schedule is out now and can be found at this link: https://one.uf.edu/soc/2191

If, for whatever reason, you do not meet the transition criteria listed above, your transition will be reversed and you will need to reach out to me for help scheduling your classes for the next term in UF Online.

You are by no means required to have an appointment with me in order to process your transition. However, if youâ€™d like to set up an appointment with me, feel free to call 352-294-2205 to set one up. If we are not available when you call, make sure to leave a message with your name, UF ID, phone number, and best time to return your call (between 8 AM and 4:30 PM EST) so we know how to get in touch with you. Congratulations again!

Best,
