UF Online vs Campus: submitted twice


record.php -- show relevant info -- "five other women's studies majors"


pending.php | states


records/sort/ -- this needs to be one page -- sort.php?submitted=approved

YOU DELETED your fixlist!

UFO has two submissions

export the data (remotely)
alex gets a note input
make the sortNav numbers links to their respective Pages -- eliminate the duplication
show submitted status on the majors layout page
only nicole can approve

contacted state is NULL from ticket creation in multiple locations (SECONDED) this matters for updates

[records/pending.php] mass differentiation? only send to two in list to test
  - remove all, and just add back one by one (seconded)
  - when email($pending) - the updated "removed" state does not revert the manually "removed"/popped student emails, leaving the pending.php field as empty
