Hi (student first name),

Congrats! You are projected to be eligible to transition to campus after this term based on your current registration. In order your transition, and set you up for future on-campus course registration, you will need to complete the following form: (LINK)

Please make sure to read this form thoroughly and follow the instructions. On the form, you will see that there are certain stipulations you must meet by the end of the semester in order to maintain your eligibility to transition to campus. If you are approved for transition, and do not meet these stipulations at the end of the term, your transition to campus will be rescinded, your future campus registration will be cancelled, and you’ll be returned to UF Online in order to meet your general and major specific transition requirements.

Please complete this form soon so we can begin the transition process. You are by no means required to have an appointment with me in order to process your transition. However, if you’d like to set up an appointment with me, feel free to call 352-294-2205 to schedule one. If we are not available when you call, make sure to leave a message with your name, UF ID, and phone number so we know how to get in touch with you. Congratulations again!

Go Gators,
