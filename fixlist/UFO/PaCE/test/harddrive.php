  <h4>Everything I Own</h4>
  <p>I was gifted a lamp over the holidays. It doesn't quite fit my desk (it's a clamp lamp deal and only has a short desk ledge). So, I was going to make an adaptor piece to hold it on the desk and write a short post about it. But my 3D printer broke -- which shifted me into budgeting mode for finances and project timelines.</p>
  <p>So, while I wait on a new printer and other project goodies to arrive, there's some time to post about removing the hard drive from my recently broken late 2009 iMac.</p>
  <p>And that hard drive holds traces of my entire 20s. So, it means a lot to me. I'm currently indexing all of my media. And it's got like, at least six months before it'll be finished. And that's overwhelming and messing with my head a little. But this hard drive being accessible again both symbolizes progression in the process, and it pays some respect to what got me to where I am today.</p>

  <p>The "shot count and success rate" post, mentioned in the previous two posts, needed a 3D-printed part, so I have to wait for the new printer to arrive before continuing that. In the meantime, the next post should be about a two-part trip where Matt and I scout and shoot along a river. I'm pretty excited about that.</p>
  <p>The new printer should be an upgrade from its predecessor. I'm excited about that. It does big, clean prints.</p>
  <p>And I have a nice, new <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Architect-Dimmable-Eye-Care-Technology-Adjustable/dp/B071ZFL133?th=1" target="_blank">desk lamp</a> to light everything up. And I'm excited about that.</p>
