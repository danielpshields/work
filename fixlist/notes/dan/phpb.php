A-man, here are some thoughts on the PHPB site:

•	Very nice css!
•	Is all the content updated and accurate? Images?
•	The CLAS logo in top left should go to clas.ufl.edu.
•	The top right UF logo should go to ufl.edu.
•	The title tags need to be updated.
•	There’s no favicon.
•	Home page: listen to the video at 25 seconds. Sounds like a large gulp?
•	Home page: should the 4 entries on the bottom link to applicable pages?
•	The contact page image is grainy.
•	Alumni success page image is blurry.
•	Advising page has an unlinked email: https://www.advising.ufl.edu/ahc/PHPB/advising.php.
•	The phone numbers in left nav and content can be linked to tel:
•	The Twitter and FB logos in left nav look left aligned. Should they be centered?
•	Is there anything about the site management that should be added to our task calendar?

I’m sure I’m missing something. 
