    <h2>Filters</h2>
    <p>Filters are the big thing in Google Analytics. They have to go in order or be paired. For instance, if results were limited like:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Include traffic from United States</li>
      <li>Include traffic from Canada</li>
    </ol>
    <p>It wouldn't filter canada because the US only includes would've been listened to first and narrowed the options</p>
