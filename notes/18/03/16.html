    <ul>
      <li>ARIA attributes are designed to be interpreted automatically by the browser and translated to the operating system's native accessibility APIs</li>
      <li>When ARIA is present, assistive technologies are able to recognize and interact with custom JavaScript controls in the same way that they do with desktop equivalents</li>
      <li role="menuitemcheckbox" aria-checked="true">Sort by Last Modified</li>
    </ul>
